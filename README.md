ENSE 374 Lab Project

    Gennerally, this lab project took us five weeks through using git hub and java IDE(eclipes) in a group. The entire project can be devided into two parts whcih are the basic structure building and functionalities realization.

Code Explaination:

    This is a small program that based on the food chain on Saskatchewan prairies. Tring to design a basic program in this lab inoder to get familiar with the UML and some basic software design principles. Users can get some basic information about the relationships about different animals especially for childrens.

Motivation:

    There is doubt that the lab mark is the biggest motivation.
